Sure, I'll explain the script line by line:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
This is the shebang line that tells the system to use the Bash shell to interpret the script.

```bash
set -uo pipefail
```
- `set -u`: Treats unset variables as an error and exits immediately.
- `set -o pipefail`: The script will return the exit status of the last command in the pipeline that failed, instead of the exit status of the last command.

```bash
SCRIPTDIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"
```
This sets the `SCRIPTDIR` variable to the directory where the script is located. It does this by:
1. `$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )`: Getting the directory name of the script.
2. `cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )"`: Changing to that directory.
3. `pwd`: Getting the current working directory.

```bash
ROOTDIR="$(cd ${SCRIPTDIR}/../..; pwd )"
```
This sets the `ROOTDIR` variable to the directory two levels up from the script directory.

```bash
[[ -n "${DEBUG:-}" ]] && set -x
```
If the `DEBUG` environment variable is set and not empty, it enables a mode of the shell where all executed commands are printed to the terminal.

```bash
if [[ $# -eq 0 ]] ; then
    echo "No arguments supplied"
    echo "Usage: destroy.sh <environment>"
    echo "Example: destroy.sh dev"
    exit 1
fi
```
This block checks if no arguments were supplied (`$#` is the number of arguments). If no arguments are provided, it prints usage instructions and exits with a status of 1 (indicating an error).

```bash
env=$1
```
Sets the `env` variable to the first argument provided to the script.

```bash
echo "Deploying $env with "workspaces/${env}.tfvars" ..."
```
Prints a message indicating that it will deploy the specified environment using the corresponding `.tfvars` file.

```bash
if terraform workspace list | grep -q $env; then
    echo "Workspace $env already exists."
else
    terraform workspace new $env
fi
```
This block checks if a Terraform workspace named `$env` exists:
- `terraform workspace list`: Lists all Terraform workspaces.
- `grep -q $env`: Searches for the workspace named `$env`. If found, it exits with a status of 0 (success).
- If the workspace exists, it prints a message indicating this.
- If the workspace does not exist, it creates a new workspace named `$env`.

```bash
terraform workspace select $env
```
Selects the Terraform workspace named `$env`.

```bash
terraform workspace list
```
Lists all Terraform workspaces, showing the currently selected one.

```bash
terraform init
```
Initializes the Terraform configuration by downloading and installing the necessary providers and modules.

```bash
terraform apply -var-file="workspaces/${env}.tfvars"
```
Applies the Terraform configuration using the variables defined in the `workspaces/${env}.tfvars` file.

In summary, this script sets up and applies a Terraform configuration for a specified environment, managing workspaces to ensure the correct configuration is applied.
