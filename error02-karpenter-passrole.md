The error message indicates that the IAM user or role executing the Terraform script lacks the necessary permissions to perform the `iam:PassRole` action. This action is required to associate the `karpenter` IAM role with an instance profile.

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the IAM user or role executing the Terraform script has the `iam:PassRole` permission. Here are the steps to achieve this:

### Steps to Resolve the `iam:PassRole` Permission Issue

1. **Identify the IAM User or Role**:
   - Determine the IAM user or role that is running the Terraform script. This can usually be found in your Terraform provider configuration or the AWS credentials used by Terraform.

2. **Modify or Attach the Policy**:
   - Add a policy to the IAM user or role to allow the `iam:PassRole` action. This policy needs to specify the roles that the user or role can pass. Here’s an example policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iam:PassRole",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::your-account-id:role/karpenter-*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace `your-account-id` with your actual AWS account ID and `karpenter-*` with the specific role name or a pattern that matches the roles you want to allow.

3. **Attach the Policy**:
   - Attach this policy to the IAM user or role. You can do this through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or Terraform.

### Attaching Policy via AWS Management Console

1. Go to the IAM service in the AWS Management Console.
2. Find the IAM user or role that runs your Terraform scripts.
3. Attach a new inline policy or managed policy with the JSON content provided above.

### Attaching Policy via AWS CLI

```sh
aws iam put-user-policy --user-name your-username --policy-name AllowPassRole --policy-document file://policy.json
```

Or for an IAM role:

```sh
aws iam put-role-policy --role-name your-role-name --policy-name AllowPassRole --policy-document file://policy.json
```

### Attaching Policy via Terraform

If you manage your IAM roles and policies through Terraform, you can add the following resource:

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_policy" "allow_pass_role" {
  name        = "AllowPassRole"
  description = "Allows passing the Karpenter role"
  policy      = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect = "Allow"
        Action = "iam:PassRole"
        Resource = "arn:aws:iam::${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:role/karpenter-*"
      }
    ]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "attach_allow_pass_role_policy" {
  role       = "your-terraform-execution-role"
  policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.allow_pass_role.arn
}
```

Replace `your-terraform-execution-role` with the name of the IAM role executing the Terraform script.

### Validate and Apply Changes

1. **Run Terraform Plan**:
   - Validate the changes by running `terraform plan` to ensure the configurations are correct.

2. **Apply Terraform Configuration**:
   - Apply the changes using `terraform apply` if the plan looks correct.

3. **Retry the Operation**:
   - Retry the operation that was previously failing. The permissions should now allow the `iam:PassRole` action to complete successfully.

This should resolve the access denied issue and allow the `karpenter` IAM role to be associated with the instance profile as required. If you encounter further issues, please provide additional details for further assistance.



SOLUTION 


Since you are using Terraform modules to install both EKS and Karpenter, you'll need to modify your IAM permissions either within the IAM module you're using or by adding a custom IAM policy to the role that Terraform is using to execute the deployment.

### Steps to Add the IAM Policy in Terraform Modules

1. **Determine the Execution Role**:
   - Identify the IAM role or user that is executing your Terraform scripts. This is typically the role configured in your AWS provider block or your credentials file.

2. **Add the `iam:PassRole` Permission**:
   - Modify the Terraform configuration to include the `iam:PassRole` permission for the identified role.

### Example Terraform Code to Add the Policy

Here’s how you can add the policy to the IAM role within your Terraform configuration:

#### Define the Policy

First, define a policy that allows the `iam:PassRole` action. You can do this by creating a new IAM policy resource:

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_policy" "allow_pass_role" {
  name        = "AllowPassRole"
  description = "Allows passing the Karpenter role"
  policy      = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect = "Allow"
        Action = "iam:PassRole"
        Resource = "arn:aws:iam::${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:role/karpenter-*"
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

#### Attach the Policy to the Execution Role

Next, attach this policy to the IAM role used by your Terraform execution. This could be the role defined in your provider configuration:

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "attach_allow_pass_role_policy" {
  role       = "your-terraform-execution-role"
  policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.allow_pass_role.arn
}
```

Make sure to replace `"your-terraform-execution-role"` with the actual name of the IAM role used to execute Terraform scripts.

#### Integrating with Modules

If your modules for EKS and Karpenter do not directly manage IAM roles for Terraform execution, you can add the above IAM policy and role attachment in a separate module or within your main Terraform configuration file that calls these modules.

#### Example Main Configuration

Here’s an example of how your main Terraform configuration might look:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

module "eks" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"
  version = "17.1.0"

  cluster_name    = "my-cluster"
  cluster_version = "1.21"
  subnets         = ["subnet-12345", "subnet-67890"]

  vpc_id = "vpc-12345678"

  # Other EKS module variables...
}

module "karpenter" {
  source  = "path_to_karpenter_module"
  cluster_name = module.eks.cluster_name
  cluster_oidc_issuer_url = module.eks.cluster_oidc_issuer_url
  enable_irsa = true

  # Other Karpenter module variables...
}

resource "aws_iam_policy" "allow_pass_role" {
  name        = "AllowPassRole"
  description = "Allows passing the Karpenter role"
  policy      = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect = "Allow"
        Action = "iam:PassRole"
        Resource = "arn:aws:iam::${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:role/karpenter-*"
      }
    ]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "attach_allow_pass_role_policy" {
  role       = "your-terraform-execution-role"
  policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.allow_pass_role.arn
}
```

Ensure that `your-terraform-execution-role` matches the role that your AWS provider is using.

### Validate and Apply Changes

1. **Run Terraform Plan**:
   - Validate the changes by running `terraform plan` to ensure the configurations are correct.

2. **Apply Terraform Configuration**:
   - Apply the changes using `terraform apply` if the plan looks correct.

This configuration should give the necessary permissions to the Terraform execution role to perform the `iam:PassRole` action, resolving the access denied issue. If you need more specific guidance based on your current setup, please share more details about your Terraform configuration.
