In your Terraform configuration, you are using a `for` expression to dynamically create the subnets for your VPC. Let's break down how the `for` loop works for both `private_subnets` and `public_subnets`.

### `private_subnets`

```hcl
private_subnets = [for k, v in local.azs : cidrsubnet(local.vpc_cidr, 4, k)]
```

### `public_subnets`

```hcl
public_subnets  = [for k, v in local.azs : cidrsubnet(local.vpc_cidr, 8, k + 48)]
```

### Explanation

1. **`local.azs`**: This is a list of Availability Zones (AZs) that you want to use for your VPC. For example, it could be `["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b", "us-west-2c"]`.

2. **`for k, v in local.azs`**: This `for` expression iterates over the `local.azs` list, where `k` is the index of the element (starting from 0) and `v` is the value of the element (the AZ name). 

3. **`cidrsubnet(local.vpc_cidr, newbits, netnum)`**: This function is used to create subnets within the specified VPC CIDR block. 
   - `local.vpc_cidr`: This is the CIDR block for the VPC.
   - `newbits`: This specifies how many bits to add to the prefix length of the VPC CIDR block to create the subnet. For example, if the VPC CIDR block is `/16` and `newbits` is `4`, the resulting subnet will be `/20`.
   - `netnum`: This is the number of the subnet, starting from 0.

### `private_subnets`

```hcl
private_subnets = [for k, v in local.azs : cidrsubnet(local.vpc_cidr, 4, k)]
```

- **`newbits`**: `4` – This will add 4 bits to the prefix length of the VPC CIDR block.
- **`netnum`**: `k` – This uses the index `k` to number the subnets.

For example, if `local.vpc_cidr` is `10.0.0.0/16` and `local.azs` is `["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b", "us-west-2c"]`, the `private_subnets` will be:
- `10.0.0.0/20` (for `k=0`)
- `10.0.16.0/20` (for `k=1`)
- `10.0.32.0/20` (for `k=2`)

### `public_subnets`

```hcl
public_subnets  = [for k, v in local.azs : cidrsubnet(local.vpc_cidr, 8, k + 48)]
```

- **`newbits`**: `8` – This will add 8 bits to the prefix length of the VPC CIDR block.
- **`netnum`**: `k + 48` – This uses the index `k` plus 48 to number the subnets.

For example, if `local.vpc_cidr` is `10.0.0.0/16` and `local.azs` is `["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b", "us-west-2c"]`, the `public_subnets` will be:
- `10.0.192.0/24` (for `k=0 + 48`)
- `10.0.193.0/24` (for `k=1 + 48`)
- `10.0.194.0/24` (for `k=2 + 48`)

### Summary

- The `private_subnets` are created by adding 4 bits to the VPC CIDR block and using the index `k` for the subnet number.
- The `public_subnets` are created by adding 8 bits to the VPC CIDR block and using the index `k` plus 48 for the subnet number.

This ensures that the subnets are distributed across the specified Availability Zones, with `private_subnets` and `public_subnets` having distinct ranges to avoid overlap.
