In Kubernetes, PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) and StorageClasses (SCs) are used to manage persistent storage. Here’s why you need them:

### PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)

A PVC is a request for storage by a user. It abstracts the details of how storage is provided, allowing users to request a specific size and access mode (e.g., read-write).

- **Purpose**: To allow pods to request and use persistent storage.
- **Flexibility**: Users can request storage without needing to know the details of the underlying storage system.
- **Binding**: When a PVC is created, Kubernetes finds a matching PersistentVolume (PV) or dynamically provisions one using a StorageClass.

### StorageClass (SC)

A StorageClass provides a way to describe the "classes" of storage available in a cluster. Different classes might map to quality-of-service levels, backup policies, or other storage differentiators.

- **Purpose**: To define how storage is provisioned (e.g., EFS, EBS, NFS).
- **Dynamic Provisioning**: StorageClasses enable dynamic provisioning of PersistentVolumes, meaning the actual storage is created on-demand.
- **Configuration**: It includes configuration details for the storage backend, such as driver types, parameters, and policies.

### How They Work Together

1. **StorageClass Configuration**:
   - Defines how and where the storage is provisioned.
   - Specifies the provisioner (e.g., EFS CSI driver).

2. **PVC Request**:
   - A user creates a PVC, specifying the required size and access mode.
   - References a StorageClass to indicate the type of storage needed.

3. **Dynamic Provisioning**:
   - Kubernetes uses the StorageClass to dynamically provision the necessary PersistentVolume (PV).
   - The PV is then bound to the PVC, making the storage available to the requesting pod.

### Example in Context

In the context of your InfluxDB deployment with EFS:

- **StorageClass**: Defines how the EFS storage is provisioned using the EFS CSI driver.
- **PVC**: Requests a specific size of storage and binds to the dynamically provisioned EFS storage.

### Updated Example

Here’s the updated example including the necessity of PVC and SC for InfluxDB with EFS storage:

#### StorageClass Definition

```hcl
resource "kubernetes_storage_class" "efs" {
  metadata {
    name = "efs-sc"
  }

  provisioner = "efs.csi.aws.com"
  reclaim_policy = "Retain"
}
```

#### PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)

```hcl
resource "kubernetes_persistent_volume_claim" "influxdb_pvc" {
  metadata {
    name      = "influxdb-pvc"
    namespace = "default"
  }

  spec {
    access_modes = ["ReadWriteMany"]
    resources {
      requests = {
        storage = "10Gi"
      }
    }
    storage_class_name = "efs-sc"
  }
}
```

#### Helm Deployment of InfluxDB

```hcl
resource "helm_release" "influxdb" {
  name       = "influxdb"
  repository = "https://helm.influxdata.com/"
  chart      = "influxdb"
  namespace  = "default"

  set {
    name  = "persistence.enabled"
    value = "true"
  }

  set {
    name  = "persistence.existingClaim"
    value = kubernetes_persistent_volume_claim.influxdb_pvc.metadata[0].name
  }

  set {
    name  = "persistence.storageClass"
    value = "efs-sc"
  }
}
```

This setup ensures that:

1. **StorageClass (efs-sc)**: Configures how EFS storage is provisioned.
2. **PVC (influxdb-pvc)**: Requests 10Gi of storage from the `efs-sc` StorageClass.
3. **InfluxDB Deployment**: Uses the `influxdb-pvc` to persist its data on the EFS storage.

Using PVC and SC abstracts the storage configuration, making your deployment more flexible and easier to manage.
