The `chown` error you're seeing with InfluxDB 2 typically occurs when the container tries to change the ownership of files or directories and doesn't have the necessary permissions to do so. This might not be an issue with InfluxDB 1.x if it does not attempt similar operations or runs under different permissions.

### Understanding the Issue

InfluxDB 2 might have different requirements or configurations compared to InfluxDB 1.x. Specifically, it could be trying to set permissions on directories that are mounted from the persistent volume, which requires the correct security context settings.

### Steps to Resolve the Permission Issues for InfluxDB 2

1. **Set the Correct Security Context in the Deployment**:
   Make sure that InfluxDB 2 is running with a user that has the necessary permissions to modify the directory. Typically, this involves setting `runAsUser`, `runAsGroup`, and `fsGroup` in the security context.

2. **Adjust Permissions on EFS Volume**:
   Ensure that the EFS volume itself has the correct permissions to allow the container to modify it.

### Example Helm Values with Security Context for InfluxDB 2

Here’s an example of how you can configure the security context for InfluxDB 2:

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsUser: 1000
  runAsGroup: 1000
  fsGroup: 1000
```

### Full Example Terraform Configuration

Here’s the complete Terraform configuration, ensuring the security context is set correctly:

#### Kubernetes Storage Class

```hcl
resource "kubernetes_storage_class" "efs" {
  metadata {
    name = "efs-sc"
  }

  provisioner = "efs.csi.aws.com"
  reclaim_policy = "Retain"
  volume_binding_mode = "Immediate"
  
  parameters = {
    provisioningMode = "efs-ap"
    fileSystemId     = aws_efs_file_system.influxdb.id
    directoryPerms   = "700"
  }
}
```

#### Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaim

```hcl
resource "kubernetes_persistent_volume_claim" "influxdb_pvc" {
  metadata {
    name      = "influxdb-pvc"
    namespace = "default"
  }

  spec {
    access_modes = ["ReadWriteMany"]
    resources {
      requests = {
        storage = "10Gi"
      }
    }
    storage_class_name = "efs-sc"
  }
}
```

#### Helm Release for InfluxDB 2 with Security Context

```hcl
resource "helm_release" "influxdb" {
  depends_on = [
    kubernetes_persistent_volume_claim.influxdb_pvc
  ]

  name       = "influxdb2"
  repository = "https://helm.influxdata.com/"
  chart      = "influxdb2"
  namespace  = "default"

  set {
    name  = "persistence.enabled"
    value = "true"
  }

  set {
    name  = "persistence.storageClass"
    value = "efs-sc"
  }

  set {
    name  = "persistence.size"
    value = "10Gi"
  }

  set {
    name  = "readinessProbe.httpGet.path"
    value = "/health"
  }

  set {
    name  = "readinessProbe.httpGet.port"
    value = "8086"
  }

  set {
    name  = "readinessProbe.initialDelaySeconds"
    value = "30"
  }

  set {
    name  = "readinessProbe.periodSeconds"
    value = "10"
  }

  set {
    name  = "readinessProbe.timeoutSeconds"
    value = "5"
  }

  set {
    name  = "readinessProbe.failureThreshold"
    value = "6"
  }

  set {
    name  = "readinessProbe.successThreshold"
    value = "1"
  }

  set {
    name  = "securityContext.runAsUser"
    value = "1000"
  }

  set {
    name  = "securityContext.runAsGroup"
    value = "1000"
  }

  set {
    name  = "securityContext.fsGroup"
    value = "1000"
  }
}
```

### Updating Permissions on the EFS Volume

To ensure the EFS volume has the correct permissions, you might need to manually set the permissions:

1. **Mount the EFS Volume on an EC2 Instance**:
   Temporarily mount the EFS volume on an EC2 instance to adjust the permissions.

   ```sh
   sudo mkdir /mnt/efs
   sudo mount -t efs <file-system-id>:/ /mnt/efs
   sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /mnt/efs
   sudo chmod -R 700 /mnt/efs
   ```

   Replace `<file-system-id>` with your actual EFS file system ID.

2. **Unmount the EFS Volume**:

   ```sh
   sudo umount /mnt/efs
   ```

3. **Re-deploy the InfluxDB Pod**:
   After setting the permissions, re-deploy the InfluxDB pod to see if it resolves the issue.

### Verifying the Deployment

1. **Check Pod Status**:
   After deploying, check the status of the InfluxDB pod to ensure it is running and ready.

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods -n default -l app.kubernetes.io/name=influxdb2
   ```

2. **Check Logs**:
   Check the logs of the InfluxDB pod for any errors or issues.

   ```sh
   kubectl logs <influxdb-pod-name> -n default
   ```

3. **Check Events**:
   If the pod is still not running, describe the pod to get more details about the readiness probe and any other issues.

   ```sh
   kubectl describe pod <influxdb-pod-name> -n default
   ```

By following these steps and ensuring that the security context and EFS permissions are correctly set, you should be able to resolve the permission issues and get InfluxDB 2 running without encountering the `chown` error. If the issue persists, please provide additional logs or error messages for further assistance.
